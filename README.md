As of April 2022, I will be a postdoc researcher at Cornell University. My research interests lie in innovation, in particular, causes and implications of inventor mobility and scientific knowledge transfer. I obtained my Ph.D. and master in Engineering from Seoul National University. Before, I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from University of California, Los Angeles.
