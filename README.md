I am an Assistant Professor at UNIST in the Division of Management Science. 

Previously, I was a Post-Doctoral Associate at the Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University. 

My research interests center on the intersection of **Economics of Innovation and Computational Social Science**. I develop and apply **big data analytic algorithms** and **causal inference techniques** to explore how the innovation ecosystem is shaped by firms, individuals, and government policies. I obtained my Ph.D. and master in Engineering (Technology Management, Economics and Policy) from Seoul National University. Before, I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA.

**"Startups, Unicorns and the Local Supply of Inventors"**
<br/>w/ Benjamin Balsmeier, Lee Fleming, and Matt Marx, Revise & Resubmit at *Review of Economics and Statistics*

The study estimates the impact of the inflow of inventors on the formation and success of local venture-backed startups, strengthening causality with a shift-share instrument based on the historic spatial distribution of millions of inventor surnames in the 1940 U.S. Census. Arrival of inventors increases the number of venture-backed startups, but only in same technology fields of the newly-arrived inventors—and at the expense of other fields. Inventor arrivals boost the number of successful startups—including $1B+ “unicorn” exits—while reducing bankruptcies and “fire-sale” acquisitions. The improvement is also driven by a reallocation of venture capital away from investment in low-tech startups, especially unsuccessful ones. <br/>

**"Academic Science and Corporate Innovation"**
<br/>w/ Matt Marx, and Lee Fleming

This study examines how academic science shapes the dynamics of the production of corporate innovation. An experiment that as-good-as-randomly exposes academic science to corporate inventors reveals that exposure to academic science increases the corporate inventors’ inventions based on science as well as inventions with a novel approach of technological application. Furthermore, while exposure to academic science leads to a decline in the number of inventions with mediocre impact, it increases the number of inventions on the extremes, i.e., inventions with no future impact and inventions that are highly impactful. The findings point to the role of academic science as a map in both scientific and technological search, albeit uncertain guidance to a dead-end or promising destination.
