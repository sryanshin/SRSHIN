I am an Assistant Professor at UNIST in the Division of Management Science. 

Previously, I was a Post-Doctoral Associate at the Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University. 

My research interests center on the intersection of **Economics of Innovation** and **Computational Social Science**. I develop and apply **big data analytic algorithms** and **causal inference techniques** to explore how the innovation ecosystem is shaped by firms, individuals, and government policies. I obtained my Ph.D. and Master in Engineering (Technology Management, Economics and Policy) from Seoul National University. Before, I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA.
