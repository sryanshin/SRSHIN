I am a postdoc researcher at Cornell University. My research interests lie in innovation from both aspects of management and economics. I apply and develop data analytic algorithms and causal inference techniques to explore how the innovation ecosystem is shaped by firms, individuals, and government policies. I obtained my Ph.D. and master in Engineering from Seoul National University. Before, I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA.

## **Working Papers**
**"Academic scientists and technological invention"**, Single-authored (Job market paper)
The study examines how the influx of academic scientists shapes commercial innovation in the local industry from the aspect of scientific knowledge adoption. To get at the causal evidence, it uses a shift-share instrument composed of two sources of plausibly exogenous variations for the regional supply of academic scientists within the United States: international mobility of scientists and historical surname distributions within the United States. The findings suggest that the supply of academic scientists increases the use of science in patenting by local corporate inventors. Specifically, incoming academic scientists increase corporate inventors’ use of scientific knowledge that is new to the geographic region as well as that is originated from university laboratories, supporting the idea that the physical presence of academic scientists facilitates knowledge spillover to the industry. The influx of academic scientists enables corporate inventors to create science-based inventions with sets of technology recombined in unprecedented and original ways. Although it leads to a decline in the overall technological impact of science-based patents owing to the sharp increase in failed inventions, it boosts the number of highly impactful science-based patents, augmenting both extremes of corporate inventions.

**"Startups, Unicorns and the Local Supply of Inventors"** [**(Link)**](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27605), with Benjamin Balsmeier, Lee Fleming, and Matt Marx
The study estimates the impact of the inflow of inventors on the formation and success of local venture-backed startups, strengthening causality with a shift-share instrument based on the historic spatial distribution of millions of inventor surnames in the 1940 U.S. Census. Arrival of inventors increases the number of venture-backed startups, but only in same technology fields of the newly-arrived inventors—and at the expense of other fields. Inventor arrivals boost the number of successful startups—including $1B+ “unicorn” exits—while reducing bankruptcies and “fire-sale” acquisitions. The improvement is also driven by a reallocation of venture capital away from investment in low-tech startups, especially unsuccessful ones.
