I am a postdoc researcher at Cornell University. My research interests lie in innovation from both aspects of management and economics. I apply and develop data analytic algorithms and causal inference techniques to explore how the innovation ecosystem is shaped by firms, individuals, and government policies. I obtained my Ph.D. and master in Engineering from Seoul National University. Before, I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA.
